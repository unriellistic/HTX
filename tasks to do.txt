- word doc for hscode
- pptx for tuas trial (done on tues)
- Then finish up the check_filename_and_copy_over... script, I think the main bulk of logic is coded in, just need to test it out. (done on tues)
- There are some images that wasn't cropped properly, need to figure out why it's so.
- Perform pre-processing for monochrome images

	+ Performed it fully through once, haven't checked yet.
	+ I think need to properly check through the base images from the start first and standardise the functions, because now it's very messy because the image names are not standardised.
	+ 4/5/2023
	+ Ok, it's standardised, finished refactoring the code. Just need to run and test whether it works.
	8/5/23
	+ Discovered another bug, after getting cropped, coordinates don't get readjusted to new boundary. also, sometimes after cropped, xmax becomes lower than xmin, need to create a logic to remove annotated box completely if it gets cropped out.

- Understand the current data class split information
	+ The data split between train/test/val, based off it's bus model and class.
