- Perform pre-processing for monochrome images
	+ 3/5/2023
	+ Performed it fully through once, haven't checked yet.
	+ I think need to properly check through the base images from the start first and standardise the functions, because now it's very messy because the image names are not standardised.
	+ 4/5/2023
	+ Ok, it's standardised, finished refactoring the code. Just need to run and test whether it works.
	8/5/23
	+ Discovered another bug, after getting cropped, coordinates don't get readjusted to new boundary. also, sometimes after cropped, xmax becomes lower than xmin, need to create a logic to remove annotated box completely if it gets cropped out.
	9/5/23
	+ Fixed bug, YOLO conversion used width and height of xml, but that wasn't updated.
	+ Fixed bug, added checking for annotation that has been completely removed by cropping.

Create inference for busxray

	+ Trying to understand what image input TridentNetPredictor takes in, current predictions are way off 640x640, up to 1700. Trying to see whether I can access the image scaling it uses (or if it even scales for this, but if not then why is the prediction so off?)

Something wrong with one of the subdir linkage in train folder, need to check tmr (preferably using gigabyte cos it takes awhile)
