- Need to run the xml2yolo function on segmented folder. Just finished performing the segmentation on the clean and threat images and copy and pasting it over. There are some images that wasn't cropped properly, need to figure out why it's so.
- Then finish up the check_filename_and_copy_over... script, I think the main bulk of logic is coded in, just need to test it out.
